[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kuhnrl30/LendingClubAccess.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kuhnrl30/LendingClubAccess)[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/gruntjs/grunt?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/kuhnrl30/lendingclubaccess)


The shiny app in this package is a replacement for Lending Club's website.  The app is uses the API bindings in the [LendingClub]([http://ryankuhn.net/LendingClub) package.

The app is very much a work in progress as is this site.
